# Harvest timetracking

Harvest API library and a set of commands

## Configuration

~/.timetracking (will be created first time you run timetracking)

```
{
    "account_id": "654321",
    "token": "abc-token-lala",
    "forecast_account_id": "",
    "weekdays_off": [
        "saturday",
        "sunday"
    ],
    "exclude_dates": [
        "2018-11-01",
        "2018-07-04"
    ]
}
```

`exclude_dates` are dates, like weekends, whose tracked hours are moved to the previous workday, if any.

Format YYYY-MM-DD obviously, as it is the only way a date should be formatted.

## Commands

### help
```
Available commands:
  help                 - print list of commands
  off                  - get a list of days off using the forecast api
  tracking             - show tracked hours
  version              - print version
```

### tracking

Retrieves all timetracking entries since `-from | now` and sums them
per day (going back `-days | 20`).

```
  -days int
        Amount of days to retrieve time entries for (default 20)
  -from string
        Custom date to start at [YYYY-MM-DD or end-of-week or next-week]
  -group string
        Group results by day|week|month|year (default "day")
  -hours int
        Amount of hours in a single workweek (default: from harvest api)
